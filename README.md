# WELCOME!
Here is my collection of scripts I have written for DCS World.
It is always ethical practice to give credit to the author in your mission briefings and server descriptions.

If you need assistance, you may reach me on Discord or ED Forums, username GTFreeFlyer.
Please enjoy!

## GTFreeFlyerTutorials:
These are not scripts to load, but scripts to read through.  I created these for people just getting into DCS lua scripting without any prior knowledge of programming.

## Nuke by GTFreeflyer:
This will create an explosion at a specific coordinate.  You can tune the size of the explosion.
See https://youtu.be/BbmyprNSidM?si=Pv9FabNUtkB4B1nT for an example.

## Ships_in_Sector:
This simulates the Essex carrier having an early radar.  Essex carriers in your mission will let you know which sector they are finding ships and bandits.  You can tune your Corsair's nav radio to listen to the morse codes and navigate your way to the enemy.

## GT_Fog_Control:
Adds randomly generated fog to the start of your mission, along with F10 menu options to change the fog to different presets on-the-fly.
If you'd like to have the fog change randomly every 5 minutes, there are instructions for that as well. 

## GTFreeFlyersUCIDGrabber:
This script grabs the UCID of players when they change slots or when they kill another player and logs it.

## Ordnance Check:
This will check aircraft in your mission for whether or not they are carrying ordnance.  If so, their aircraft will explode after climbing to a certain altitude.
This is used to enforce fair play in civilian-style multiplayer missions.
