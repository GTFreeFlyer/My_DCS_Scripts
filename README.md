# WELCOME!
Here is my collection of scripts I have written for DCS World.  
It is always ethical practice to give credit to the author in your mission briefings and server descriptions.  
Please feel free to submit issues, suggestions, or pull requests through github.  
If you need assistance, you may reach me on Discord or ED Forums, username GTFreeFlyer.  
Please enjoy!

### GTFreeFlyerTutorials:  
These are not scripts to load, but scripts to read through.  I created these for people just getting into DCS lua scripting without any prior knowledge of programming.  

### ExplodeWeakUnits:  
Causes weak enemy units to explode once reaching a certain health threshold.  
You have control over which unit types, or entire categories, this will apply to.  
Each unit can have their own individual settings.  
When a unit explodes, flares will shoot out of it as the explosion occurs, for visual effect.  
Example usage 1:  Ships can be difficult to sink, so you can set them to blow up after reaching 50% life.  
Example usage 2:  The Anton seems like it takes way too much damage compared to another aircraft, so you can tune that here.  

### GTFF_Aircraft_Diagnostics:  
Use this for quick aircraft perfromance testing.  
It will display some text in the top of your screen with additional info such as fuel consumption, ground speed, etc.  
Discussion, and a .miz file can be found here: https://forum.dcs.world/topic/378058-engine-diagnostics-script/#comment-5690603

### GTFreeFlyersUCIDGrabber:  
This script grabs the UCID of players when they change slots or when they kill another player and logs it.  
Useful if you need to ban someone from your server.  
So, even if they change their MP session name, the ban would still be in effect.  

### GT_Fog_Control:  
Adds randomly generated fog to the start of your mission, along with F10 menu options to change the fog to different presets on-the-fly.  
If you'd like to have the fog change randomly every 5 minutes, there are instructions for that as well.  

### GT_Laser_Script:  
Creates a laser from any object to another object, stationary or moving.  

### Nuke by GTFreeflyer:  
This will create an explosion at a specific coordinate.  You can tune the size of the explosion.  
See https://youtu.be/BbmyprNSidM?si=Pv9FabNUtkB4B1nT for an example.  

### Ordnance Check:  
This will check aircraft in your mission for whether or not they are carrying ordnance.  
If so, their aircraft will explode after climbing to a certain altitude.  
This is used to enforce fair play in civilian-style multiplayer missions.  

### Ships_in_Sector:  
This simulates the Essex carrier having an early radar.  
Essex carriers in your mission will let you know which sector they are finding ships and bandits.  
You can tune your Corsair's nav radio to listen to the morse codes and navigate your way to the enemy.
